<h1>What is htaccess in PHP?</h1>
<p>
.htaccess is not part of PHP but part of Apache server. <br>
This file used to configure web servers running with apache.<br>
htaccess mostly used in cases where you don't have access to the main configuration files of apache cause using this file slows the server. (for example shared hosting)
